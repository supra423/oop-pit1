So now you're here because you might be wondering how does this work?
As I'm writing this, I'm just going to run through the main logic
by explaining the classes and a bit with the GUI.

PRODUCTS CLASS:
Products is a record class which contains a name and price field,
with a constructor and getter functions. This class is usually
used when defining the hardcoded products itself

note: Record classes are classes that already has a canonical constructor,
getters, and other special methods, it is just a fancy way to reduce some
boilerplate.

PRODUCTDATA CLASS:
ProductData is also a record class that is primarily used in the Inventory class
when hardcoding the values of the products along with its associated image and its
size dimensions.

BOUGHTITEM CLASS:
The BoughtItem class only contains a Product type variable and a quantity, the difference
between the BoughtItem class and Product class is that the BoughtItem class is used
when actually handling the purchase itself, I initially thought on placing a quantity field
in the product, but it didn't seem to make that much sense, so I instead created a different
object for it. So whenever a user clicks on a certain product, a pop-up menu should prompt the
user to type in the quantity of the product chosen, after that, an instance of an object
from the BoughtItem class is then created.

ORDER CLASS:
The Order Class contains an ArrayList which stores the BoughtItem objects, there is also
a unique id for it and a totalcost by adding up all the price in the arraylist.

INVENTORY CLASS:
The Inventory Class contains the hardcoded objects from the Product class,
The name and price are hardcoded here and then stored inside an array so that this array
will be used to display the products. This also has a getter function

SALESINVENTORY CLASS:
The SalesInventory Class contains an ArrayList which stores the Order objects, not much has been
added in this class by the time this has been last written.
